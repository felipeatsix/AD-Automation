# ActiveDirectory_Scritps

My Powershell scripts for automating some of Active Directory Domain Services tasks.

I've learned the techniques of these scripts mostly from PluralSight Powershell advanced courses which I highly recommend everyone who is interested in learning Powershell.

These scripts are totally compatible with any Active Directory environment.
