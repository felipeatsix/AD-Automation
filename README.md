# ActiveDirectory_Scritps

Some of my Powershell scripts for managing Active Directory Domain Services.

I've learned these scripts mostly from PluralSight Powershell Advanced courses which I highly recommend everyone who is interested in learning Powershell.

This scripts are totally compatible with any Active Directory environment.
